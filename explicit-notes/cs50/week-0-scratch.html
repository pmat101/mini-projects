    Computer Science is the study of information. How do you represent it, and how do you process it? And in that sense, computational thinking is just the application of ideas from computer science.

    Computers use Binary system to represent data, 'A' is 65, 'B' is 66, '!' is 33, '1' is 49 and '2' is 50.
    This pattern of 0s and 1s are interpretted differently in different softwares, text in email, numbers in Excel or colours in photoshop.
    ASCII only used 8bits which gave only 256 possibilities, along came Unicode which used 32bits (a little expensive) but gave 4 billion possibilities to encorporate all languages and even emojis.
    Emojis are characters and not pictures, so look different on each device just like fonts.

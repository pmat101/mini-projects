    1.  JavaScript can be executed inside the browser's console, using the Node.js runtime environment or inside <script> tags of an HTML document.

    2.  var a = 7   => variable declaration: keyword (var) identifier (a) assignment (=) operator literal (7)

    3.  'var' is globally scoped while 'let' & 'const' are block scoped.
        'var' can be updated and redeclared within its scope, 'let' can be updated but not redeclared while 'const' can neither be updated nor redeclared.
        'var' is initialised as undefined whereas 'let' & 'const' are not initialised (throw reference error if accessed before declaring).
        'const' must be assigned a value during declaration.

    4.  Primitive Datatypes => NULL, NUMBER, SYMBOL, STRING, BOOLEAN, BIGINT, UNDEFINED

    6.  Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, ** (exponent), % (mod), ++ (increment), -- (decrement).
        Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=.
        Comparison operator: ==, !=, ===, !==, >, <, >=, <=, ? (ternary operator)
        Logical operator: && (and), || (or), ! (not)

    7.  Pop-Up boxes    => Alert, Confirm, Prompt.
        parseInt and parseFloat used to convert value to number

    9.  Types of loops  => For, For-In (run through keys of an object or array), For-Of (iterates through values of arrays or strings), While, Do-While

    11. Functions allow separation of logic and use DRY principle

    13. Template Literals use backtics{`} and allow single/double quotes inside, they also allow variables inside using String Interpolation.
        Escape Sequence is used to write special characters in a string, eg. \', \", \n, \t, \r

    14. String properties and methods   => length, toUpperCase, toLowerCase, slice(start, end), replace(og_str, new_str), concat, trim, includes(part_of_string), startsWith(), endsWith()

    16. Arrays are mutable but strings are immutable

    17. Array properties and methods   => toString, join(separator), pop, push, shift, unshift, concat, splice, slice(start, end), reverse,
    delete - leaves empty space,
    sort - alphabetical; add a function to change comparison method

    19. forEach => runs a function for each array item
        Array.from => create array from any other object type
